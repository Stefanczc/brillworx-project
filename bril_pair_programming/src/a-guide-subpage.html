                    <p>Did you know that 96 per cent of people who visit your website are not ready to buy? At the same
                        time, some websites are known for their highly successful efforts for turning visitors into
                        customers. How do they do it? What makes their online presence different from everybody else’s?
                        <br><br>
                        A number of website components play an important role when it comes to audience retention and
                        conversion. The performance of your website, its speed, interactivity and content are all
                        crucial.
                        <br><br>
                        What do people see first when they land on your pages? Are they conductive of building a
                        long-term
                        relationship? This is one of the most important questions to ask yourself when attempting to
                        boost
                        conversions. If you’d like to see a bigger percentage of your web traffic turning into
                        customers,
                        you’ll have to do a couple of important things.
                    </p>
                    <h2>BOOST WEBSITE SPEED</h2>
                    <p>A well-developed, functional website should load fast. Today’s online audience has a limited
                        attention span. If website design and content don’t make an excellent first impression in a
                        couple
                        of seconds, chances are that you’ll see a high bounce rate and a small conversion percentage.
                        <br><br>
                        The hard truth is that you have eight seconds to make your case. After these eight seconds, most
                        people will leave your website and never come back.
                        <br><br>
                        If you already have a website, you should do a speed audit. Many tools are available for the
                        purpose
                        of testing your website’s speed and figuring out what the main problems are. One of the most
                        effective and simple tools to rely on is the page speed tool by Google.
                        <br><br>
                        In case you’re just getting started with website development, you should choose a company that
                        understands the importance of fast loading and that adheres to the strictest industry standards.
                        There are numerous things that developers can do to reduce the size of every individual page and
                        make it load faster. You may want to inquire about the company’s strategy prior to getting
                        started
                        with development.
                        <br><br>
                        Keep in mind that fast loading is even more important when it comes to mobile traffic. The
                        average
                        time spent browsing via a smartphone is growing. According to August 2016 statistics, the
                        average
                        monthly time people spend browsing via their phone is 87 hours in the US and 66 hours in UK.
                        <br><br>
                        The rate of abandoning a website that doesn’t load fast is even higher for mobile than for
                        desktop
                        users. Since mobile is already taking over as a primary method of accessing websites, your
                        efforts
                        should focus on providing these users with the best possible experience.
                    </p>
                    <h2>MAKE THE USER EXPERIENCE YOUR MAIN PRIORITY</h2>
                    <p>You’ve overcome the first test and people aren’t leaving your website in a matter of seconds. The
                        next thing to focus on is the user experience.
                        <br><br>
                        The user experience consists of multiple elements that get people engaged and interacting with
                        your
                        website. Navigation, functionalities, easy contact options and the content are all parts of the
                        user
                        experience that can result into website visitors becoming customers.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to increase conversions, you’ll first have to highlight the most important website
                        elements
                        that the audience should be paying attention to.
                        <br><br>
                        When developing every single page, think about the buttons and the links that matter the most.
                        Contrasting colours when creating a “sign up” or a “buy now” button can be used to show the
                        audience
                        what you deem to be most important. Such design elements will be visible immediately, getting
                        people
                        to check out what you have to offer.
                        <br><br>
                        Good calls to action that pop up are also effective. The trick with this strategy, however, is
                        to
                        refrain from overdoing it. If a call to action pops up every three seconds, people will leave
                        your
                        website quite annoyed.
                        <br><br>
                        Strategic visual cues can be used on every single page to tell people what you want them to do.
                        These visual elements will determine which aspects of the page they’ll pay attention to and even
                        how
                        they’re going to read – from left to right, starting from the centre of the page, etc.
                        <br><br>
                        The use of arrows, animation and other graphic elements will make it obvious what the visitor
                        should
                        be paying attention to. In order to make the strategy successful, you’ll have to work with an
                        experienced designer. A professional in the field will know the significance of each element and
                        the
                        best way to utilise it in order to increase engagement.
                    </p>
                    <h2>EXPERIMENT WITH BUTTONS</h2>
                    <p>There’s a lot you can accomplish by simply putting the right call to action button on a landing
                        page
                        or experimenting with its placement.
                        <br><br>
                        Something as simple as the colour of a button can have an effect on conversions.
                        <br><br>
                        Web development companies have found out that turning buttons red, for example, can have a
                        profoundly positive effect on the conversion rate. People see red as a colour of dominance, the
                        colour of red hot deals. Thus, a simple change from a green to a red call to action button can
                        lead
                        to a 34 per cent increase in conversions.
                        <br><br>
                        The placement of the button is also important. While it was previously believed that a call to
                        action button should be positioned above the fold, tests reveal that it performs better when
                        placed
                        underneath text. The reason is that the text provides some information about the purpose of the
                        call
                        to action button, making it easier for people to relate.
                        <br><br>
                        On top of button colour and placement, button text is also an important element. Thus, website
                        developers and copywriters should be working together for the best possible results. A good call
                        to
                        action button appeals to emotions. It also creates a sense of urgency, making people undertake a
                        certain action before thinking twice.
                        <br><br>
                        “Buy now” buttons tend to turn people off. Many people worry that by clicking, they’ll be
                        charged
                        instantly. Thus, working with the text can produce much better results. Some of the button texts
                        that are perceived as less threatening and that can contribute to higher conversions include
                        “add to
                        shopping cart” or “find out more.” These buttons leave people with an option – if they’re not
                        certain, they can always give up on finalising the purchase.
                    </p>
                    <h2>LOOK FOR HIDDEN PROBLEMS</h2>
                    <p>Why aren’t people converting? Maybe the problem is that they can’t rather than that they don’t
                        want
                        to.
                        <br><br>
                        A problem in the flow of the conversion funnel could be keeping people from finalising the
                        process.
                        Thus, sitting down to test every single functionality can reveal an issue that you were
                        previously
                        unaware of.
                        <br><br>
                        There’s a simple way to figure out if something is wrong – complete every single step you’d want
                        a
                        potential customer to undertake. Are you getting stuck? Are you finding it impossible to move
                        from
                        point A to point B? If so, some of the functionalities aren’t as logical and user-friendly as
                        you’d
                        like them to be.
                        <br><br>
                        You can repeat the same experiment with a few friends or a couple of co-workers. Figure out
                        where
                        they’re getting stuck or experiencing difficulties. Remember that a website visitor isn’t going
                        to
                        dedicate an awful lot of time to finding the resolution. If something isn’t immediately
                        accessible,
                        people will simply give up on moving forward.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you identify the weaknesses in the conversion funnel, work with an experienced web
                        development
                        team on simplifying the process. If possible, eliminate some of the steps. Make it crystal clear
                        right from the start what you’re attempting to accomplish and give people a simple set of steps
                        to
                        complete.
                    </p>
                    <h2>PUT A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON YOUR HOMEPAGE</h2>
                    <p>While landing pages are incredibly important for accomplishing your marketing goals, your
                        homepage is
                        the face of your business online. This is the main reason why a lot of your website development
                        and
                        design efforts should be focused on putting together a clean, trendy and functional homepage.
                        <br><br>
                        Make the homepage concise and highlight the key elements right from the start. Even if they
                        enter
                        your website through an ad and a landing page, many people will also visit the homepage to find
                        out
                        more.
                        <br><br>
                        The homepage should also be the centre of website navigation. It should come with an intuitive
                        menu
                        and a link to the most important pages. If people can’t reach a key part of your website through
                        the
                        homepage, they will not bother again.
                        <br><br>
                        Intuitive navigation and presenting the website structure on the homepage is also important for
                        search engine optimisation. Thus, by focusing development efforts on the structure of the
                        primary
                        page, you’ll be getting even more search traffic (thus, increasing your chances of generating
                        leads
                        and getting new clients).
                        <br><br>
                        Remember that homepage design trends change all the time. What matters is staying true to your
                        brand
                        and knowing what your audience is looking for. Customising the appearance of your homepage can
                        quickly boost audience engagement.
                    </p>
                    <h2>MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO CONTACT YOU</h2>
                    <p>The final thing you should be focusing on is simplifying corporate communication. If you make it
                        easy
                        for people to contact you, a bigger number of prospects will get in touch.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the simplest possibilities is adding a live chat option to your website. One experiment
                        suggests that the addition of a live chat button to a website can increase free signups by 31
                        per
                        cent.
                        <br><br>
                        Any contact form on the website should be simple and easy to fill out. Refrain from demanding
                        too
                        much information right from the start. Once people get in touch with you and request more
                        information, you’ll have an opportunity to access more valuable insights.
                        <br><br>
                        If people need a university degree to discover the contact information and put it to use,
                        chances
                        are that they’ll give up on your business. Thus, you may want to feature this information
                        prominently in the footer as well as on a separate page.
                        <br><br>
                        A final thing to remember is to respond to inquiries promptly. Website visitors have taken the
                        time
                        to ask you a question or request information about your products. Fast, courteous and
                        comprehensive
                        responses will help you build your brand’s reputation and boost satisfaction from the
                        interaction.
                        <br><br>
                        Increasing your website’s conversion rate requires a strategy and some innovative thinking. Try
                        to
                        put yourself in the shoes of the website visitor. Poorly constructed, slow and difficult to
                        navigate
                        websites will never succeed. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to focus on improving these
                        faulty
                        components. The amount you invest in website development or redesign will yield a high return on
                        investment that will justify the extra expenditure.
